This is a script for the processing and plotting of CSV or JSON output from
YCSB.

It is designed to automate result capture and plotting for my honours thesis
( News for which is located at http://cloudproject.tumblr.com/ )

This was made under crazy time pressure and is due for some heavy-duty refactoring.

Instructions and CLI interface forthcoming.

Requires matplotlib, scipy, and numpy.
